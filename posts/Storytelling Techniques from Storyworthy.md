As a software engineer, I spent years believing that technical skills were the only path to success. Programming languages, software design patterns, and system architecture dominated my learning priorities. It wasn't until I started working in Germany that I realized how shortsighted this view was.

The transition exposed two critical gaps in my skillset. First, my English needed improvement. Second, and more fundamentally, my cultural background made me hesitant to speak in groups. I would avoid public speaking, especially in meetings with more than three people. While gradually overcoming this fear, I discovered another crucial skill I lacked: storytelling.

## The Revelation

"How hard can storytelling be?" I used to think. "Why would a software engineer need this skill?" I couldn't have been more wrong. Even after gaining confidence in public speaking, I still struggled to communicate ideas effectively. My messages often required multiple back-and-forth exchanges to be understood. The missing piece wasn't technical knowledge—it was narrative structure.

Looking back at my university days, I realize I systematically avoided opportunities to develop this skill. I would handle the content preparation in group projects but always delegate presentations to more confident speakers. I surrendered countless chances to improve, creating a deficit I now must address.

## Learning from "Storyworthy"

In search of guidance, I found Matthew Dicks' "Storyworthy." The book opened my eyes to several fundamental principles of compelling storytelling:

### The Power of Personal Perspective
- **Make every story your own**, even when sharing someone else's experience. For example, tell your view of your grandpa's story. Instead of just telling your granddad's story, start the story from you and explain your role. Also, mention your view of the story.
- Pass the **Dinner Test**. Tell stories naturally, as you would at a dinner table.
- **Connect with your audience**. Focus on moments that resonate with your audience—sometimes small, relatable stories impact more than grand narratives. 

### The Five-Second Moment
- Every story needs a **transformative moment that changes you**.
- Build your narrative around this pivotal point.
- Highlight details that enhance this moment, minimize those that don't.

### Setting the Scene
- **Ground your audience with precise locations**. Give your audience a cinematic experience, like watching a movie while listening to the story.
- **Start from a point that contrasts with your five-second moment**. Ensure that the you at the story's beginning is different from the you at the end. Change is necessary.

### Language and Structure
- To improve the flow of the story, use **"but"** and **"therefore"** instead of "and (then)."
- **Use negative statements for emphasis**. Negatives in a sentence give more power, and there is a hidden "but" when using negatives.
- **Present complex ideas through small, relatable moments**. Big stories are usually more difficult to tell. They need a small moment that the audience can relate to comprehensively.
- **Use present tense to create immediacy**. Tell the story in the present tense to draw your audience to the exact moment.

### Building Suspense
- **Surprise** is the crucial element in the story.
- **Avoid a thesis statement in storytelling**. That will reveal your story upfront.
- **Create contrast between surprise moments and their setup**. Heighten the contrast between surprise and the moment just before surprise.
- Raise the stakes to increase impact.
- **Plant important details early without revealing their significance**. Avoid giving away the surprise by hiding important information that will pay off later. (planting bombs)
- **Distance key information from its eventual payoff**. Placing them as far away from the surprise as possible.
- **Use humor to mask crucial elements**. Build a laugh around them to camouflage their importance further when possible.

### Continuous Improvement
The key to better storytelling is consistent practice. One big part is "**Homework for Life**." Write down your stories every day. The suggested approach is to prepare a spreadsheet and briefly summarize the impactful moment in your day. This moment can be small but makes you think and realize something. Those moments can be a good source of stories in the future.

The other way to practice is "**Dreaming at the End of Your Pen**." To practice this, better prepare a physical pen and paper, and allocate an undisturbed 15-minute time slot. When starting, please pick up a random word, and start from that word, write what comes to mind, when the new ideas or memories kick in, write them down and keep your flow going. After the whole period finishes, check out what you have written down, usually there will be a couple of good moments in each turn. Those can also be great resources for the story's material.

The last approach the author suggested is called "**First Last Best Worst:** Great for Long Car Rides, First Dates, and Finding Stories." This is like filling a form with specific prompts. For example, you can give prompts in columns like: First, Last, Best, and Worst. And for the rows: Kiss, Car, Pet, Trouble, Injury, Gift or Travel... etc. Then, you start to fill in what is in your mind that fits the combination of prompts. What you filled in might be potential story elements.
## Moving Forward

Understanding the importance of storytelling has transformed my communication approach as a software engineer. It's not just about presenting technical information—it's about making it accessible, engaging, and memorable. This journey has taught me that soft skills aren't secondary to technical expertise; they're essential multipliers that make our technical skills more effective.
